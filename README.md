#### Overview

We chose the State of Hawaii Executive Branch IT Portfolio & Roadmap Visualization challenge for this years HACC2020.
This challenge asks us to make the State of Hawaii IT portfolio visible to the public.
We plan on creating a user friendly visualization from the data provided. 

#### How To Run

The webapp can be previewed [here](https://sharp-borg-ed125d.netlify.app/).

In order to run this application on your machine, you will need Node, which can be installed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You will need the code which can be cloned or downloaded from the [repository](https://github.com/HACC2020/Crewmates.git):
```
git clone https://github.com/HACC2020/Crewmates.git
```
Make your way into the project directory:
```
cd Crewmates
```

You will then need to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Finally, start the application typing:

```
npm start
```

If everything went well, you will see the app running on localhost:3000 in your default browser and if it doesn't automatically pop up then you can open a new tab and enter in the address localhost:3000 to get to the app.
